# Testing

- Manual testing of each section of the site (such as buttons, links etc).

- Testing site responsiveness (using a site like https://responsivedesignchecker.com/  ). 

- Code validation (CSS/HTML/JS using online tools like https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and JSHint).

- Testing of all user stories.

- Documentation of any bugs encountered and their resolution steps. 

- Documentation of any open bugs (ideally, test cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website).
