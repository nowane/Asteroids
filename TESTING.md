# Testing

- Manual testing of each section of the site (such as buttons, links etc).

- Testing site responsiveness (using a site like https://responsivedesignchecker.com/  ). 

- Code validation (CSS/HTML/JS using online tools like https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and JSHint).

- Testing of all user stories.

- Documentation of any bugs encountered and their resolution steps. 
    - When trying to get the onscreen keyboard to work I tried al sorts of things to get the hidden letters accepting the letters from user iput. I had a function split up in three different pieces. One piece of the function per 1 row of letters on a keyboard. In the end the solution took me about a day an a half to come up with, and I came across it by accident.. It came down to the fact I used uppercase letters in the keyboard rows, and those did not work on the words to be generated I put in - being lowercase.

- Documentation of any open bugs (ideally, test cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website).
